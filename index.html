          Over 70 million people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide with 1.9 million deaths. 
          The United States has the highest number of cases at 16.5 million confirmed, followed by India 
          with 9.8 million. Therefore, the United States has ~24% of total confirmed cases despite having 
          ~4% of the total world population. Meanwhile, India holds ~18% of the worldâ€™s population with ~14% 
          of total confirmed COVID-19 cases.

          The disproportionate rate of COVID-19 cases continues to expand with the third wave of cases. 
          In order, the three countries with the highest cases are the United States, India, and Brazil. 
          Together they represent ~46% of all confirmed cases in the world. The following chart isolates the 
          confirmations of these countries.

            Following October, the United States has seen an explosion of new COVID-19 cases representing 
            the third wave of infections. This third wave is breaking records, with more new cases than both 
            previous waves combined. With the current data it is unclear if the third wave has reached the peak, 
            or if the growth will continue. The disproportionate rate of infections to population is growing 
            rapidly.

              The interesting results can be found in the state of New York. New York is the fourth largest state 
              with 19.7 million people and home to the city with the largest population, which should be 
              disastrous during a pandemic. However, New York has only had 789,000 cases compared to the 857,000 
              cases in Illinois, with a population of 12.9 million.

            Looking at the start of the pandemic, New York experienced a disproportionate number of infections 
            and deaths. The number of infections can primarily be attributed to the densely populated New York 
            city, which overloaded their healthcare infrastructure resulting in many deaths. What is unexpected 
            is how New York has handled the pandemic following the first wave of cases.
          </p>
          <p>
            New York drastically reduced the number of new cases and deaths. The state was able to completely 
            avoid the second wave of infections, where other states seen an increase of infections compared to 
            the initial wave. While New York is currently experiencing the third wave, it has been able to 
            retain infections similar to the first wave with a fraction of the deaths. Meanwhile, California 
            and Texas are developing more infections with each new wave.
