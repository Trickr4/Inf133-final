- Appropriate navigation between pages
- Appropriate Headings and text

CSS 
- Modified margins and padding for readability
- Modifed colors
- Custom fonts from Google fonts

Tableau Content
- Data compiled by John Hopkins (Changed)
  Comment: We used a different than the project plan provided. The new source still gets data from John Hopkins, but allows for much easier updates to the data (Following the goal of the bonus requirement, additional details in that section).
- Data displayed in graph and table formats with filters for country, month, deaths, and total number.
- Two visualization stories, each containing multiple graphs/tables along with textual discriptions. S
  Comment: There are multiple graphs put together to make a single visualization. While there are 4 total visualizations, there are over twice as many graphs used to create them.

Responsiveness
- Designed with accessibility in mind, using semantic elements and descriptive alt attributes
- Will use responsive design for varying screen sizes

Validity
- HTML and CSS validated by W3C
- Accessibility validated byh AChecker

Documentation
- Code includes comments when required

Bonus Requirement (Mostly Completed)
- While the entire process wasn't automated, the vast majority of the work required to update the visualizations was automated.
  * Our initial expectation required manually combining two separate csv files along with other edits (removing unnecessary rows/columns and creating a new column with an algorithm over thousands of rows). Afterwards, we would save that file as an .xlsx file to be used in Tableau. We had to complete this process with every update. 
  * Instead, we click one button to update the data then save the visuals to Tableau Online (two clicks each).
